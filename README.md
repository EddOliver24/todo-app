The Todo App is a simple and intuitive task management application built with React.js. It allows users to add, manage, and remove tasks with ease. The app features a clean interface where users can:

*Add New Todos: Enter task details and click the "Add Todo" button to add it to the list.
*Toggle Task Completion: Click on a task to mark it as completed or incomplete. Tasks are visually updated to reflect their status.
*View Task Status: Each task shows its status as either "Done" or "Not Done" with color-coded labels.
*Remove Tasks: Delete tasks from the list with a click of a button.

The app uses localStorage to persist tasks, ensuring that they remain available even after refreshing the page. It features a user-friendly design with vibrant colors to enhance the overall user experience.
